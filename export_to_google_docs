CHALLENGE
I sometimes want to export responses or content from GPT into Google Docs but different file types import into Docs with varying levels of success and accuracy.

SOLUTION
I performed a series of tests, exporting content from GPT in different file types, importing them into Docs, and assessing their accuracy. Exporting from GPT/importing to Docs using an HTML file worked the best.

PROMPTS
Generate an HTML document from your last response that I can download here.
