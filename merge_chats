CHALLENGE
Sometimes, a single topic I am working on with GPT gets split across multiple chats but I want to be able to talk with GPT about everything on the topic we've discussed from all the related chats so far.

SOLUTION
In each chat, ask GPT to generate a downloadable transcript file of the entire chat so far, and then upload these to the chat you want to continue the conversation in.

PROMPTS
In the previous chats:

  Generate a transcript of our entire conversation so far as a downloadable text file.

In the active chat:

  The attached documents are transcripts of other GPT chats. Review them and consider their contents as we go forward in our conversation.
