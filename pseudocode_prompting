CHALLENGE

Sometimes it's more convenient to explain a process using pseudocode. We know GPT can attempt to write code but can you make your requests in code?

SOLUTION

Yes, you can! GPT accepts pseudocode as a way of asking it to perform a process. This enables you to blend pseudocode into your prompts and logic, which can mean less typing and more accuracy.

PROMPTS

* Use pseudocode. Space can be used instead of tabs:

	Prompt:

		I have a few colors and a few numbers. Red, green, blue and 2, 4, 6. Can you...

		for each color
		   for each number
		      print(append the number to the color)

	Output:

		Here are the color-number combinations:

			Red2
			Red4
			Red6
			Green2
			Green4
			Green6
			Blue2
			Blue4
			Blue6

		These are the results of appending each number to each color.
