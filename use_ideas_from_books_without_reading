CHALLENGE
There are many useful frameworks and methods to learn in the world but reviewing the original materials - entire books or lecture series - these come from can be time-consuming. Sometimes, I want to be able to explore and experiment with the key ideas without needing to review these materials in full.

SOLUTION
GPT is familiar with many popular books and can generate content based on them. Instead of reading the entire original material - the book, etc. - I start by exploring it with GPT's help, asking for summaries, discussing finer points, showing examples, and ultimately generating a framework that GPT can help me apply to my specific problems. The original book can then be read in-full later, if useful.

PROMPTS
* Give an overview of the book Atomic Habits by James Clear.
  * Give a list of the most essential ideas in the book.
  * Provide a framework I can use to apply the ideas from the book.
    * Help me apply this framework to this problem: [describe problem]
