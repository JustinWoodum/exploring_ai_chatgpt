CHALLENGE
GPT can be somewhat "lazy" when it researches a topic. It seems to often default to the most official page it can find for a target topic or organization, and then relies on that source to answer questions - it doesn't look for other pages such as social media pages or third-party websites where more information may be available. Instead, GPT just says it can't find the needed information.

SOLUTION
Sometimes prompts can be engineered to improve GPT's initial research but when nothing seems to work, there is usually one thing that does: asking it to try again or "try harder". This often leads to additional information being found without any additional prompting other than this single phrase!

PROMPTS
* Try harder.
