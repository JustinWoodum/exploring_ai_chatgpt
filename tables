CHALLENGE
I would like to display information in a table.

SOLUTION
I use a single prompt to generate the table. GPT usually generates a table directly in the text, without using any additional codeboxes or windows. It usually includes headings automatically.

PROMPTS
Generate a table where column 1 is the list of organizations, column 2 is their number of employees, and column 3 was their revenue for last year. If you don't know, please write "UNKNOWN" in the cell. Don't leave any cells blank. Display the table here.

  * The purpose of "Display the table here" is to prevent GPT from generating the table within a codebox, as HTML code, or in some other format.
